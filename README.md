two's complement converter

By: Alex Sisco

# WaveForm Analysis
-------------------
This Waveform is correct because it produces the apropriate two's 
complement binary number outputs based on the two's complement 
binary input. I tested this by comparing the outputs of Isim 
to the outputs on my truth table.
